## How To Help Bitcoin Users In Just A Few Hours

In the last three months, Bitcoin.org has served over [7 million page
views][]. Two million page views alone went to popular new-user resources
such as the [Getting Started][] page and the [Choose Your Wallet][] page. A
not-insubstantial 90,000 page views went to the [Developer
Documentation][]---and over 4,000 page views went to the new [How To Run A
Full Node][] guide within just days of it being launched.

Over 35 percent of the page views were by users from outside the US and
UK, where Bitcoin.org's translation into 26 different languages allows
over half of the world's literate population to learn about Bitcoin in
their native language.

Every substantial change to Bitcoin.org is submitted for [public review][]
and comment, with 439 comments being received this period from about two
dozen participants.

But despite all these accomplishments, we know we could do better... if
only we had a little help.

### A Critical Look At Bitcoin.org

Do you frown when you open Bitcoin.org in your browser? Is there
something you wished the site did differently? What new pages could
be added that would help new users---or even help the more
experienced users who don't yet fully understand Bitcoin?

Before you answer, think about whether you'd be willing to volunteer
just a few hours to make those changes. Because what the site needs more
than ideas are people willing to contribute the work to see those
changes through.

### Five Ways To Contribute

Here are five things you may be able to do:

1. [Watch the Bitcoin.org repository][] to be notified of issues and pull
   requests that could use your attention. Alternatively, email
   volunteer coordinator Dave Harding, <dave@dtrt.org>, with a short
   list of your interests and skills, and he'll email you when there's
   something that could use your attention.

2. Help us [review wallets][] that want to be included on the popular
   Choose Your Wallet page. Reviewing a wallet requires a lot of
   research and testing, but you often get a chance to work directly
   with the wallet authors to find bugs and suggest improvements.

3. Write some CSS or Javascript to make the site look the way you think
   it should. Before you spend too much time writing code, [join our
   mailing list][] and send us some mock-ups.

4. Create content, whether it be beautiful new illustrations that explain
   Bitcoin intuitively, or new technical text for the developer
   documentation, or a brand new page that helps users learn how to do
   something like buy their first bitcoins.

5. Translate Bitcoin.org into another language using [Transifex][] or help
   review new and updated translations.  Even if all you speak is
   English, we're looking for a translation coordinator who can answer
   translator questions and help process reviews.

If any of the contributions above interest you, the best place to start
is by sending an email to the volunteer coordinator, <dave@dtrt.org>.
You can also [post to our mailing list][] or [open an issue on GitHub][].
